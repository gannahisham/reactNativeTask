This is a simple mobile app that displays a list of posts from a public API, allows users to tap into a post to view its details, and shows related comments. It is built using **React Native**, **Expo**, **TypeScript**, and **CSS**.

The list of posts is acquired from the **GoRest API**.  
Each post card shows the post title, a preview of the post body, and a randomly generated username and avatar (not from the API).

Tapping on a post opens its details, along with any existing comments related to that post.

Each comment includes a name and body, and is styled with a mock avatar and generated username to keep the interface visually consistent.
